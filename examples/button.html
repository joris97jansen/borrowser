  <body style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.2;">
    <p>
      This is a paragraph with an inline
      <button>Click me</button>
      button that should appear in the same line as text.
    </p>

    <p>
      Long text before the button to force wrapping and show that the
      <button style="width: 140px;">Wide button</button>
      behaves like a single inline glyph and moves to the next line if needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Buttons can appear
      <button>between</button>
      words without breaking layout.
